                <h1>Chairman's Statement</h1>
                <p>Hospitality investments are continuously growing all over the world. There will be approximately one million additional rooms available for sale in the coming years, and total available hotel rooms will reach 12,5 million. More than 70 % of these investments have been planned in Asia/Pacific, Americas and in Middle East. Close to 550 new hotels with a capacity of 90.000 rooms will be opened in Europe and, of course, Middle East Market plans to reach up to 120.000 rooms from 422 projects in the next 3 to 5 years.</p>
                <p>As AHK Group, we are proud to have been involved more and more in these new projects. In the last few years, our performance in completed projects like, Ibn Batuta Gate Mövenpick Hotel, Anantara Royal Amwaj, Meydan City, Waldorf Astoria on Palm Jumeirah all in Dubai, UAE has given us more confident about our capabilities and enabled us for bigger challenges.</p>
                <p>With this motivation and confidence, we have recently undertaken signature projects such as Grand Hyatt Hotel in Abu Dhabi, Bvlgari Hotel Dubai, W Hotel Dubai, Westin Hotel Dubai, Sheraton Sharjah Resort, St. Regis Polo Dubai, Raffles Hotel and Residences in Istanbul, Nirvana Resort in Antalya, Hilton Al Houara Coastal Resort in Morocco, Hilton Salwa Resort in Qatar, Mandarin Hotel and Residences in Bodrum. Currently, we are working in UAE, Turkey, Russia and Azerbaijan and have been in contacts for projects in Belarus, Qatar, Kazakhstan and Spain. Presently we are eager to expand our distinctive services and quality of production to these countries.</p>
                <p>Certainly all these would not have been possible primarily without the trust of our clients and also surely without the hard work, discipline and expertise of my colleagues in AHK and our long term partners outside of AHK who supplied us with workmanship and material. I would like to express my gratitude and sincerely thank to all for making AHK what it is today.</p>
                <p>We hope and would be honored to be at your service.</p>
